Gustup is a simple tool that helps groups decide where to eat — together.

This early demo allows users to:

- Create a group  
- Invite friends via WhatsApp or a shareable link  
- Set preferences, allergies, budget, audience target and age range  
- Let a basic algorithm suggest the best restaurants within the selected radius

## 🎯 Why I Built It
Choosing a restaurant as a group is usually messy.  
Different tastes, allergies, and budgets turn a simple decision into a long discussion.

Gustup simplifies this by letting everyone vote quickly through tools they already use (WhatsApp or a link).

This is an **early prototype**, built to gather real feedback.
